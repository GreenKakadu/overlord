Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

You should have QT version 4.0 or higher installed on your system.
If you have no QT you can take it from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

  1. Variable "ENGINE_DIR" in Sextant.pro should point to the directory on your computer  with Overlord engine code.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code (PbmServer or sextant).

  3. call "qmake PbmServer.pro" or "qmake Sextant.pro"  then "make"

     This should produce binaries named "PbmServer" or "Sextant"
