Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.


The simplest way to compile this package on LINUX/UNIX systems is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
     This should produce binary named "Overlord"

  3. You can remove  object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Windows systems.

You may import all *.cpp and *.h files into your compiler IDE and add all
directories to your include directories list. "turn.cpp" contains "main".

Another way is to try to use Cross-platform Making utility CMake  (www.cmake.org)
To do this you should download and install CMake on your computer
and then run CMakeConfig. CMakeLists.txt contains input for CMake.
With CMake you should be able to generate MSVC project and Borland Makefile.
(I don't think these will work without adaptation)
