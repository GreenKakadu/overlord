<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">In 1998&nbsp; Vincent Archer&nbsp; developed generic

games.
Overlord (1998-1999) was the first PBEM game that used this engine,
later
this engine was also used Rise of Heroes game (1999 - 2000). Engine
allows
running Atlantis-like Play-By-e-Mail &nbsp;games using&nbsp; complex
world
model with high level of customization.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">The goal of the Overlord project is to&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Develop new version of Overlord Engine for public
use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Provide support to Game Masters who would like to
use engine in their games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Coordinate efforts on developing tools and
modifications for Overlord engine.<br>

<h2>Overlord Engine <br>
</h2>
<p align="left">Original <a href="http://www.frmug.org/pbm/">code</a>
of Vincent Archer is available from his site.<br>
This is working code but experience of Rise of Heroes exposed numerous
problems with it's exploitation <br>
so it was decided that it should be&nbsp; better rewritten. <br>
</p>
<h2>Overlord game<br>
</h2>
<p align="left">Overlord is<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span>Atlantis-like
Play-By-e-Mail Strategic game with strong role-playing component</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Economic system</span>:
Main source of income are
taxing/pillaging. Game use title system and taxing is allowed to
titleholders only. Working and entertainment money are limited.
In some cases trade can provide very good income too.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat system</span>
is one of the strongest sides of
Overlord. Units are
placed on the 3x6 battlefield. During the battle they can move, use
melee or ranged attacks, defend, use items and cast spells.&nbsp; This
system is not too sophisticated, so that it is possible to intuitively
predict battle outcome. Stone-paper-scissors balance works very well,
so that there is no ultimate winning tactics. Notable is a role of a
magic in combat: there are no powerful destructive spells - instead
of that magic plays role of powerful attenuating factor.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Magic system</span>:
200 spells. Casting spells&nbsp; implemented as using magic
skill. Magic skills are divided to 5 schools (fire, water, earth, air
and void). Mana and sometimes components (items) are required for
casting spell.&nbsp; Magic may be used in combat as well as in everyday
life for enchanting items or units, creation temporary and permanent
effects.<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill system:</span>
400+ skills (including magic skills). Using skill adds experience. Only
low levels of
skills can be studied and further progress is possible only through
teaching or using skill.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Items:</span> 400+
items (many of them - handmade unique items) <br>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game world</span> is
versatile, with handmade special locations.<br>
Faction growth is limited by control points system so that generally
player
can't control more than approximately 200 units<br>
</p>
<p align="left">Popular opinion of those who played Overlord is that it
was very successful game.<br>
