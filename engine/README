			2. Use

Before running engine (Overlord) you should set game directories and configuration.

File "game" contains configuration parameters.
The most important of them are: GAMEDIR and PLAYERSDIR - these should be set 
according to your's directories containing rulefiles, entities data and players subdirectories.

GAMEDIR is a directory where engine will look for game rulefiles as skills, items etc.
( items, races, skills, terrains, titles, buildings, directions, stats, 
 stances, movements are  rulefiles)
PLAYERSDIR is a directory where engine will look for orders and where it will place reports.
	For each faction there should be subdirectory in PLAYERSDIR, containing orders file.
	Orders file should be named orders.n, where n is number of turn.

UNITSFILE FACTIONSFILE LOCATIONSFILE   are names of files containing entities data
(units factions and locations data).

TURN  is current turn. It should be identical to extention of order files.
	so if TURN is 5 you should name order file order.5
