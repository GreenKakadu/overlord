Overlord Engine ToDo list:

Last updated 14.05.2004
==================================================================================
	Alpha version features:
-Combat.
-Actions implementation
-combat-related Orders
-Guarding/Patrolling/Stances
  -- Start/Stop Guarding
	-- Attacks due to stances
	-- Restrict actions on guarded territory
-faction statistics
-Location developement
-Weather and season effects
-CP
 -- calculation
 -- CP limitation

   Post-Alpha features:

- Alias names for units
- Checker.
=================================================================================
Things to do:

- add item types: (living, mineral etc) - variety?
- title cancellation
- eating raw products like grain or cattle for upkeep is not implemented
- unit that borrows money or food for upkeep to other units doesn't keeps 
		money or food for it's own upkeep
- Conditional order reporting ('!'  '?')
- Define static type of reporter (ERROR, NORMAL...) for use in conditional order reporting.

- unit defeated in battle loses GUARD flag

Things to check:

- check all orders that have unit parameters for using 	DOWNCAST_ENTITY<UnitEntity>(parameters[0]);
- forget removes skill bonuses
Features to change/improve:

- when disbanding unit allow restacking of followers (like in eject order)
- Smart Drowning
- item bonuses to level limit : applyEquipementEffects()
- skill bonuses to level limit
- controlled monsters of oathing units should oath too.
- faster movement (i.e. mode remains the same but movement is faster)
- let SEE order accept [faction] parameter
- let GET order interpret missing unit/location parameter as current location.
- Conditions (Skill) may be demanded to enter location/Building
- add/remove Unit/Entity to locations
- create SkillEquipCondition and SkillTitleCondition <- not urgent as no leader supposed to use forget
- Make keyword and parent in GameData static and reconsider to replace second constructor with clone method

Solutions  to change/improve:

- Provide order-id whenever possible, use it to filter !-like report modificators
  for that provide static field defining report type (sucess, fail, invalid) in Reporter and ability in ReportPattern to read it


- Incorporate possibility of placeholders into tokens so that it becomes invisible from outside
  (make all placeholders/alias completely internal)





hierachy of reporting: routines that will be used for reporting both in Units and Constructions

- elements may be as parameters (they may be saved, parsed) ???
 But use of elements in reports should be avoided because they may report not their current state
  but the state at the time of report printing.
==========================================================================================
Known Bugs/features:

4. orders given to new units. Placeholders
   should have place for orders and when they
	 are transformed into unit they should copy that orders.

7. STANCE FRIEND as order to set default stance is not supported
 ( it is also not requered and not documented)
 Problem is in distinguishing correct and incorrect varieties values
8. OATH transfers unit to a new faction but old faction doesn't
 receive report of unit actions duiring turn.
9.	As reports generated at the end of turn, changing entity name have backward effect.
10.	Unit enters location in post-turn phase. so AT commands works only on the next day.
22.
23.

Portability:

In Compillation with Borland C++BuilderX data structures use much more memory than with GCC (try to play with data allignment)
Big scale code(200 factios x 100 units 10000 locations)  BCC-compiled with debugging  first time runs ok but on second time hangs computer.(but my computer regulary hangs anyway)
