<h3> 1.0 General Concepts.</h3>

<div align="center">
<pre>General principles and concepts of Overlord engine design</pre>
&nbsp; </div>
<div align="center">
<h3> 1.1 Overlord Game Engine object paradigm:</h3>
</div>
<p><br>
Imagine, that we have unit A consisting from 20 men, with 20 swords.
Are we going to represent each man and each sword as separate object?
Definitely not. We can assume that all men are equal and swords are
undistinguishable so&nbsp; It's enough to have one object for all men
and one object for
all swords and inventory record that we have 20 of them. Such objects
are
called <a href="#Rules">Rules</a> and such inventory records - <a
 href="#Elements"> Elements</a>. At the same time we consider all units
being
(potentially) different, so each of them represented by separate
object. Such objects are called <a href="#Entities">Entities</a>
.&nbsp; Entities are stored in special&nbsp; <a
 href="#2.5_Collections.">Collections</a> . Game objects may show very
complex behaviour - for instance skills may be classified
by the way, how they can be learned (mundane skills, magic skills,
creature
skills etc) and by the way how they are used (craft skill, combat
skill,
summoning skill etc). &nbsp;Each type of behaviour may be represented
by
<a href="#2.8_Strategies.">Strategy</a> object. Many types of object
behaviour is conditional, so we would like to have object representing
these <a href="#2.6_Conditions.">Conditions</a> .&nbsp; In some cases
configuring game object properties may be more efficiently done with
use of special objects such as <a href="#2.7_Varieties.">varieties</a>.<br>
<small style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255);"><small><br>
</small></small>&nbsp; </p>
<div align="center">
<h3> 1.2&nbsp;<a name="Polymorphic_Persistence"></a>Polymorphic
Persistence.</h3>
</div>
<p><br>
Game data (<a href="#Entities">Entities</a>)&nbsp; should be stored
between turns. <br>
This means that Entities should be&nbsp; Persistent Objects. <br>
If we now want to allow polymorphism,&nbsp; Entities&nbsp; should
be&nbsp; Polymorphic Persistent Objects. </p>
<p>Polymorphic Persistent Object may be loaded from the disk (database)
or saved to the disk (database). <br>
And all derivatives of this object may be loaded from the disk as well.
What's important here is that one doesn't need to know the type of
object before loading. Object has built-in procedure of
self-identification and self-building. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Other polymorphic persistent objects
(<a
 href="file:///home/alex/engine/overlord/docs/en/DesignDoc.html#Rules">
Rules</a>, <a href="#2.8_Strategies.">Strategies</a>, <a
 href="#2.7_Varieties.">Varieties</a>, <a href="#2.6_Conditions.">Conditions</a>)
&nbsp;&nbsp; may be also efficiently used for game confuguration.&nbsp;
</p>
<div align="center">
<h2> 2.0 Object classification</h2>
</div>
<p><br>
Data used in Overlord Game Engine may be classified into the following
cathegories, which are reflected in object names: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<div align="center">
<h3> 2.1<a name="Rules"></a> Rules.</h3>
</div>
Rules represent properties and specifications&nbsp; of game world
objects. <br>
Rules provide confugurability of the game world. Rules may be refered
by tag. <br>
For Overlord they are: <br>
&nbsp; - ItemRules - defines&nbsp; properties of items. <br>
&nbsp; - SkillRules - defines skill properties, learning conditions
and way they are used. <br>
&nbsp; - RaceRules - defines racial characteristics, abilities and
trends <br>
&nbsp; - TitleRules - defines Titles, their benefits, condition of
claiming and rules for challenging <br>
&nbsp; - TerrainRules&nbsp; defines&nbsp; terrain properties (plain,
forest... ) <br>
&nbsp; - ConstructionRules - defines&nbsp; properties of Ships and
Buildings <br>
&nbsp; - fx_actions.rules<br>
&nbsp; - enchantments.rules<br>
&nbsp; - seasons.rules<br>
&nbsp; - weathers.rules<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">
<h3> 2.2.&nbsp;<a name="Entities"></a>Entities.</h3>
</div>
Entities are most important game objects. Entities are refered by ID,
which is prefix + id number. <br>
For Overlord they are: <br>
&nbsp; - GameEntity (aka GameInfo)- Instance of the Game World <br>
&nbsp; - FactionEntity&nbsp; - Factions <br>
&nbsp; - LocationEntity - Locations <br>
&nbsp; - UnitEntity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Units <br>
&nbsp; - SingularityEntity - Global Effects like Tornado, flood or
plague. (TBD) &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; - ConstructionEntity - Ships and Buildings. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<div align="center">
<h3> 2.3.&nbsp;<a name="Elements"></a>Elements.</h3>
</div>
&nbsp; Elements are minor game objects. Element contains reference to
some Rule&nbsp; (or Entity) and typically one or two Parameters.
Element always belongs to some entity&nbsp; and can't exist by
themselves. There are enormous number of elements and they are the
biggest part of a&nbsp; game data. On the disk Elements are stored
inside&nbsp; records of Entity which owns them. Elements may be created
and deleted.&nbsp; Memory consumption by Elements is a crucial factor.
That's why custom memory allocator/deallocator should be used for
Elements instead of standard <b>new </b>/ <b>delete</b>. (these are
use few extra words for each allocation). Elements <i>equiality </i>is
determined by equiality of their&nbsp; Rules and Element <i>equivalence
</i>is determined by both equivalence&nbsp; of their&nbsp; Rules
and&nbsp; parameters.<br>
I.e.for&nbsp; two elements Element1 {Rule1; Parameter1;} and &nbsp;
Element2 {Rule2; Parameter2;}<br>
Element1 == Element2 if <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rule1 == Rule2<br>
and<br>
Element1 &lt; Element2 if <br>
( Element1 &lt; Element2) or (( Element1 == Element2) and&nbsp;
(Parameter1 &lt; Parameter2) <br>
<br>
This allows for instance to use STL find to determine either unit has
any swords in inventory and to use STL searching routines for
determining either unit's skill knowledge is high enougth. <br>
<br>
Elements should be stored in vectors and these vectors may be sorted
vectors for the case when the speed of the searching is important. (Why
not maps? Because for relatively small collections sorted vectors are
more
memory and speed efficient than associative containers)<br>
<br>
In many cases Elements themselves (not references) are stored in
Element Containers. Copy constructors should be provided.<br>
<br>
Examples of Overlord Elements:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; ItemElement (contains ItemRules pointer, amount of items and
amount of equipped items) <br>
&nbsp; SkillElement (contains SkillRules pointer and level of
knowledge) <br>
&nbsp; RaceElement (contains RaceRules pointer and amount of specimen) <br>
&nbsp; TitleElement (contains TitleRules pointer and pointer to
Location Entity)&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; StanceElement&nbsp; (contains StanceVariety pointer and pointer
to target Entity) <br>
&nbsp; ResourceElement (contains ItemRules pointer and amount of
resource) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ReportElements&nbsp; (contains ReportPattern pointer,
pointer to Entity, producing this report and time, when report was
created)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TravelElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PermissionElement<br>
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WeatherElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConstructionWorksElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EnchantmentElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FactionPermissionElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InventoryElement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MovementElement<br>

<div align="center">
<h3><a name="2.5_Collections."></a>2.5 <a name="Collections"></a>Collections.</h3>
</div>
<br>
Collections&nbsp; are used for storing similar type of objects. They
are also supporting some additional operations: They are responsible
for finding specific object in the collection. Collections&nbsp; are
also responsible for&nbsp; element insertion or deletion. &nbsp;They
have no knowledge about the way their elements stored, but they are
able to load elements from the storage and save them to storage<br>
Examples of Collections:
<p> RuleCollection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeps Rule
objects. One collection per Rule type. This is Unique Associative
Container.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
EntityCollection &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp; Keeps Entity objects. One
collection per Entity type.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EntityCollection is&nbsp; based on preallocated STL vector with
Entity's id&nbsp; used as&nbsp; index. <br>

VarietiesCollection<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="2.6_Conditions."></a>2.6 <a name="Conditions"></a>Conditions.</h3>
<p>Condition objects may be used in order to provide additional
generalization to the rules. It's easy to hardcode into Item rule that
some skill may be demanded for equipping. But what if you want Item,
that may be equipped only by some race or by holder of some title? Of
course one can derive a class TitleSpecificItemRule. But then another
problem appears: if unit looses title item should be unequipped. How
can it be done? Should we check all equipment each time title(or skill
or something else ) lost? And not only equipment - there may be more
dependencies)<br>
Title, skill or some other ability loss is essentially asyncronous
event and should be treated with something interrupt-like.<br>
Condition objects provide generic solution for this problem. Now
if&nbsp; object defines some part of it's functionality as conditional,
Condition object generated. Condition object knows which game object it
depends on and similar to interrupt handlers binding Condition&nbsp;
provides handling routine and binds it to object it depends on. When
some change in this object happens it checks conditions binded to it
and calls their handlers.&nbsp; Note that skill conditions&nbsp; for
item equipment and title holding are different type of objects because
they define differenr handling procedures.<br>

<h3><a name="2.7_Varieties."></a>2.7 <a name="varieties"></a>Varieties.</h3>
<p>Let's consider geographical directions on the map (East, West,
North,
South etc)</p>
<p>Normally these directions may be represented by enumerated type. But
we want also to be able to report information about direction used in
verbal form and also to have verbal input from the player. In addition
to that
we may have some special directions that are treated differently (for
instanse IN_TO_PORTAL direction). &nbsp;Again Polymorphic Persistent
object are one of possible solutions here. Such objects are called
varieties here. <br>
Examplese of Varieties are <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MovementVariety - movement modes (walk, ride, swim,
fly, climb etc) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StanceVariety - possible stances between factions
(allied, friendly, neutral, unfriendly, hostile)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirectionVariety - set of directions (N, S, NE, NW,
SE, SW, IN, OUT etc)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EquipementSlotVariety - possible equipement slots on
the body (weapon, shield, helm etc.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConstructionWorksVariety<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CombatFileVariety<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CombatMoveVariety<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CombatRankVariety<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CombatStanceVariety<br>

<h3><a name="2.8_Strategies."></a>2.8 <a name="policies"></a>Strategies.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strategy is one of &nbsp;standard <a
 href="http://www.exciton.cs.rice.edu/JavaResources/DesignPatterns/StrategyPattern.htm">design
patterns</a>. <br>
Example of strategies are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LearningStrategy - describes skill-specific learning
demands and limitations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StudentStrategy - describes race-specific abilities
to study skills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UsingStrategy - defines the way how skill is used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MarketStrategy - responsible for local trading
operations. <br>
&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<h3>2.9 <a name="Attributes"></a>Attributes.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entities&nbsp; have some properties characteristics
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">attributes</span> (such as set of
items, skills or titles) that are treated in similar way: they may be
added to entity or removed from it, entity may be checked for having
some attribute and so on. In many case attributes also persistent so
they shouls be also loaded and saved. So it is reasonable to group all
these operations into one type of&nbsp; objects that have similar
interface.<br>

 name="Data_pre-processing"></a>Turn pre-processing<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Loading</span> -
creates all game objects, that are mentioned in rules or data files<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Initialization</span>
- inititializes&nbsp; all created objects with data from rules or data
files. (This is done in two stages because otherwise objects may be
refered before they created) <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Consistency check</span>
- performs some checks of data correctness (for instance that every
unit is assigned to some location)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Data preparation</span>

<h3><a name="3.2_Day_processing"></a>3.2 <a name="Day_processing"></a>Day
processing</h3>
Turn processing include the following stages:<br>
Daily preprocessing <br>
Orders processing<br>
Conflict Resolution<br>
Daily postprocessing<br>
<h3>3.2.1 Daily pre-processing</h3>
Some operations&lt; performed before day processing.&nbsp; Mainly&nbsp;
clearing flags. <br>
<h3>3.2.2 Order processing <br>
</h3>
Orders are processed daily. There are several <span
 style="font-style: italic;">phases</span> of order processing <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immediate orders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stack orders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combat resolution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full-day orders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; competitive requests resolution<br>
On each phase order processing engine tries to process all orders but
only some of them may be proceesed.&nbsp; Immediate orders may be
processed on any stage&nbsp; but stack orders and full-day orders may
be processed only on their respective phase. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>3.2.2.1 Conflicts</h3>
<p> <br>
Conflict happens when two (or more) entities are trying to perform
actions that are contradicting each other or just can't be done at the
same time. Examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit trying to enter guarded territory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit trying to pillage on guarded territory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several units are harvesting limited resource.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several units are buying/selling the same product on
the
market.<br>
</p>
<p>The first two cases cause combat. Combat is a special case of
conflict caused by processing of immediate or stack orders.<br>
</p>
&lt;&gt;Example:<br>
If we
have
Location with 5 wood/day resource and 2 units each being able to
harvest 4 wood/day then the amount of wood each unit will be able to
harvest will depend on actions of the other unit. This is a conflict.
<p>Currently all conflicts are hosted by Locations but they may be
assigned to other kinds of entities too. There are different types of
conflicts. For instanse:<br>
- Even Conflicts - where all request are equal and limited resource
distributed
equally and the rests randomly<br>
- Market Conflict - requests are served based on market model.<br>
There are also conflicts that are solved daily and conflicts that are
solved only on some days(Market Conflict on Market days) or at the end
of month (wages
payed)<br>
</p>
<h4>3.2.2.2 Requests<br>
</h4>
<p>
When order processing may depend on orders given to the other <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Entities</span>
present at the same Location, processing can't be done instantly
and should be postponed. For that purpose <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Request</span> is generated. It should be
submitted to local conflict resolution system, represented by <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Conflict</span> object. When
order
processing is completed and all <span style="font-weight: bold;">Requests</span>
are submitted, they will be
sorted,
conflicts detected and resolved. <br>
</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2.2.3 Conflict
Resolution.</span><br>
</h4>
<p>When it's time comes each conflict is <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>pro</i></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>ces</i></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>sed</i></span><b
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><i>.</i></b><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> </span>All
requests
are sorted by their critical resource type (or some other property) so
that several independent conflicts formed. Then each independent
conflict
should be<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>re</i></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>so</i></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>lved</i></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><i>.</i> </span>Resolution
is a procedude deciding
what is conflict outcome (for instance how
much of resource should get each request, or who wins a battle). Then
each <span style="font-weight: bold;">request</span> gets
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">answer</span>.
Answering request is done by <span style="font-weight: bold;">request</span>
object and may include&nbsp; requested resource acquisition,
reporting
results. In many cases &nbsp;finishing request processing may determine
order
processing result (such as SUCCESS or FAILURE) so order processing
should
be updated for that unit (request inside answering method calls <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OrderLine's </span>method<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><i style="text-decoration: underline;"> </i></span><i
 style="text-decoration: underline;">completeProcessing</i><span

Example: The weather on the next turn is calculated for each location

<h2>4. Combat Processing<br>
</h2>
Two players of combat processing are CombatManager and CombatEngine<br>
Combat processing is done by CombatEngine and&nbsp; CombatManager
determines combat participants<br>
<br>
<p>How combat processing is done:<br>
<br>
CombatManager (CM) resolves all combat requests and also orders that
may cause combat (pillage, guard) and determines how many combats will
happen at location, which units will participate in combat and on which
side.<br>
<br>
CombatEngine (CE) Processes one single combat.<br>
Consists from pre-processor, round processor and post-processor<br>
<br>
pre-processor<br>
&nbsp;It determines tactical bonuces,<br>
<br>
Round processor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; round pre-processing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear flags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; update orders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plan orders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calculate initiative for this
round<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; round processing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each initiative try to
process action and movement orders (two separate lists)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; round post-processing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine combat end conditions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moves enchantment counters<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
post-processor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deals with dying units<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributes loot and titles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gives experience<br>
<br>
<br>
All orders are divided to sequentual and non-sequential<br>
Sequential are Overlord Combat style orders that are processed strictly
in sequence, i.e. if current order can't be processed at current
initiative it will wait for initiative.<br>
Example:<br>
PARRY (init -2) &lt;-- processed<br>
MELEE (init 0)<br>
<br>
<br>
Non-Sequential are Overlord non-Combat style orders that are processed
according to initiative, i.e. if current order can't be processed at
current initiative processor will try next order in the list.<br>
Example:<br>
PARRY (init -2)&lt;-- processed if melee targets are nor available<br>
MELEE (init 0)&lt;-- processed if melee targets are available<br>
<br>
Combat Order processing is done by CombatOrderProcessor (COP)::process<br>
<br>
Checks conditions ('+' and '-' - not used for sequential orders)<br>
try to process order by calling CombatOrderLine (COL)::process<br>
deal with order processing consequences by calling
(COP)::processOrderResults<br>
<br>
Now it's a time to explain the&nbsp; diference between orders and
actions.<br>
<br>
The order is an instruction for order processor that may be processed
or not depending on the situation. Duiring execution Order normally
translated into&nbsp; some action or sequence of actions to be done
when executing.<br>
<br>
Orders are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retreat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use<br>
<br>
Actions are some actions that may be performed by entities duiring
combat.<br>
Entities duiring combat may move and/or attack or perform some actions.<br>
Entities Movement is not considered an action and processed by
BattleField::moveEntity() method.<br>
<br>
Some combat ations actually last longer than one initiative segment
(example is multi-hit attacks, that are defined in such way that hits
next to the first should be inflicted at lower initiative value). This
doesn't fit well into current combat model and implemented as a hack:
there are isProcessingRepeatingOrder flag may be set on Entity. If such
flag is active no orders will be checked and RepeatingOrder will be
executed (if possible)<br>
<br>
Actions are:<br>
&nbsp;Melee (melee attack)<br>
&nbsp;Ranged (ranged attack)<br>
&nbsp;Special (<br>
<br>
&nbsp;special actions are normally result of using APPLY &lt;skill&gt;
or USE &lt;item&gt;. SkillRule or ItemRule in this case will have
CombatActionStrategy field pointing to some specific CombatAction that
should be performed when this skil/item invoked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Before action may be executed the list of possible target should
be determined. This is done while processing order (because if no
target available, action is not possible and order can't be executed).<br>
&nbsp;Then action is executed by calling CombatAction::makeAttack method<br>
<br>
virtual ::makeAttack&nbsp;&nbsp; Performs attacks (generally by calling
virtual ::attack method of actual CombatAction) against all potential
targets untill all of them are dead or maximum hits is reached. For
special (non-melee/ranged) actions it should be overwritten by specific
method.<br>
<br>
<br>
::attack calls actual method for single target attack resolution (such
as meleeAttack, rangedAttack)<br>
<br>
Result of such single attack is returned in MeleeAttackElement
structure.<br>
<br>
they are summarized in CombatActionStrategy::makeAttack and later may
be used for generation reports like<br>
" Allied Guards[U520] strike 2 times against Stealth Infiltrator[U411]
for 3<br>
damage slaying all."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2>5. Report Processing</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
=======<br>
<br>
<br>
Normally Reports are produced by orders processing but may be also
result of some game events.</p>
<p>Typically report The problem with reports is that game generates a
lot of them so that reports may consume a lot of memory so we would
like to save memory. Typically report consists from some pre-defined
words (that are part of code known at compillation time) and some
variable data. So we would like to save on these pre-defined words by
using ReportPatterns.<br>
</p>
<p>Report Message&nbsp; consists from&nbsp; some&nbsp; number of
pre-defined words (strings) - these are Report Pattern&nbsp; and some
number of parameters.</p>
<p>Report Messages differ based on number of parameters they support.
So a set of pre-defined strings that are used by report pattern is
called ReporterPattern and ReportMessage just contains ReportPattern
and some number of parameters. Report Message then occupies much less
space than full report text and may generate text of the report.<br>
</p>
<p>Next we have ReportRecord which consists from ReportMessage,
ObservationCriteria condition and OrderId. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ObservationCriteria Object provides condition that unit&nbsp; should
meet in order to observe and be able to report some event. These may be:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Possesing some level of observation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Possesing some level of skill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Possessing some item<br>
ObservationCriteria inmplemented as condition object<br>
<br>
Events which are seen differently by units with different levels of
ObservationCriteria (for instance uncommon resources or foreign unit's
affilations) should be represented by Report Branch: set of reports
with
different ObservationCriteria, where each next record adds additional
info
for the previous ones.<br>
<br>
Finally ReportElement contains pointer to ReportRecord and some
additional keys
for&nbsp; sorting (Unit, Location, Day of report).<br>
<br>
<br>
ReportCollection keeps local ReportRecords of some Location or global
ReportRecords of whole World. It has tree-like structure, where some
ReportRecords stored in Report Branches.<br>
<br>
ReportElementCollections keeps ReportElements. Should support sorting
by 2 keys. <br>
<br>
Factions may have more than one ReportElementCollections each dedicated
to some section of faction report.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Global Reports<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combat Reports<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unit Reports (sorted by Unit and Day)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Location Reports&nbsp; (Sorted by Location
and Day)<br>
<br>
How it works: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Manipulator produces ReportRecord and places it into ReportCollection
of Location where it happened (local report) or World (global report).
ReportRecord may be also placed into ReportCollections of adjacient
Locations
(may be with more severe&nbsp; ObservationCriteria). At the end of day
all
units that are still alive, try to report local events to their
factions.
To do that ReportManipulator compares ObservationCriteria with Unit's
possesions and abilities in the case of success ReportElement containig
refeence to&nbsp; ReportMessage placed into corresponded faction's
ReportElementCollections&nbsp; (How to do it efficiently and how to
avoid reporting the same things many times - TBD) <br>
After the end of turn processing ReportManipulator creates faction
report, calculates faction statistics, faction ranking, prints into
report faction statistics, faction ranking, Sorts
ReportElementCollections for each section and prints them. Then creates
and prints orders.<br>
<br>
<br>
As most common ObservationCriteria is observation level it may worth to
create for each faction, temporary collection of all present at the
location units&nbsp; sorted ReportElementCollections&nbsp; <br>
